# py-xiaozhi Documentation Directory

This directory contains all functional documentation for the py-xiaozhi project, organized by functional modules for easy reference and use.

Currently, MCP has been fully migrated and includes built-in features for Bazi (Chinese astrology), marriage compatibility, system functions, 12306 railway queries, online search, "What to eat today" (recipe recommendations), countdown timer, online music, and vision (three methods: Xiaozhi official vision, Zhipu, and Ali). Other modules can be extended and enabled as needed.

The project has now enabled the v2 authorization protocol, with WSS links returned through the OTA interface. Both official Xiaozhi and open-source backends have aligned authentication processes.

**Role definition addition: Prioritize using external extension tools (MCP/IoT), don't be lazy about execution. This ensures MCP or IoT tools are executed, but there's still a chance to trigger system tools with similar functions, in which case it may need to be prompted.**
